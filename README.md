# Autism-App
A visual app to help children with autism communicate easier. 

## Backstory

Children on the Autism spectrum currently use a Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) to communicate their needs to an adult. This requires the children to tediously go through a file of pictures just to communicate one action. As you can imagine, the addition of all those times a child has to flip through a file of pictures can be exhausting and time consuming. Our mission is to make this easier for them. We want to optimize this process to make it simple for the children to communicate to an adult. Optimizing this process will not only allow the children and adults to save time, but it will allow the children to have a lower cognitive load.

### Example of current Picture Exchange Communication System

## User Interface

"While good UI design is important for any software development effort, itâ€™s even more important when designing for individuals on the autism spectrum."

It is in our best interest to be mindful when we are making this app. UI design will be extremely important in this case. One study noted that ease of personalization was determinated to be a key factor in developing successful applications for people on the spectrum.
