# Autism-App
A visual app to help children with autism communicate easier. 

## Backstory

Children on the Autism spectrum currently use a Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) to communicate their needs to an adult. This requires the children to tediously go through a file of pictures just to communicate one action. As you can imagine, the addition of all those times a child has to flip through a file of pictures can be exhausting and time consuming. Our mission is to make this easier for them. We want to optimize this process to make it simple for the children to communicate to an adult. Optimizing this process will not only save time for the adults and children, but it will allow the children to have a lower cognitive load.
